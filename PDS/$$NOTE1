Sam,

I am not working at a site with HSC at the moment either.

I can also supply the source, but I can not assemble it at the
moment because I am missing the HSC macros.

All you need to do to run it is:

(1) Libdef the panels
(2) Call GJNHSC00

GJNHSC00 links to the Storagetek API so you need that for it to
run.

Gerard

Hi Gerard,

    I am looking at the SDS stuff, and it seems to me that you
need a text document describing how to install and set up this
package, and also what it's good for.  I tried looking at the
.doc file and it just shows screen shots.  We need some clear
install doc, it seems to me.  If I'm wrong, please let me know.
I tried to install the stuff on my system, and got some "could
not load" messages.  But I don't have Storage Tek software here.
So that's probably why.

    Thanks again for your (always) good work.

    All the best of everything to you and your family.

Sincerely,    Sam

Please also find an ISPF front end to StorageTek's HSC program
for the CBT Tape.
